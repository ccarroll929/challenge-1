Project Title: Module 1 Challenge Assignment

Description: In this project, I took the starter-code of a finished webpage and made modifications to the code in order to reach my outlined goals. My goals for this project were to add a descriptive title element in order to improve Search Engine Optimization, add descriptive "alt" messages to make images more accessible to users, and to simplify/reorder the code so there are not any unnecessary repeated elements and to ensure the code is written in the correct sequential order. These changes improve the overall function of the website as well as the readability of the code.
